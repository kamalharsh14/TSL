'Electrical testing of equipment and report generation in online mode'

Tata steel boasts an exceptional variety of electrical equipment and machinery to
maintain the smooth functioning and analysis of the steel making process. But,
currently, the traditional method of recording the results in a piece of paper is
posing threats of invisibility and miscommunication. The offline records are not
readily available everywhere and the lack of data analytics and insights results in
the loss of information. Also, entering this data into the database and lack of
visibility of tracking of the entire cycle may cause errors, and eventually result in
loss of the data. Maintaining digital records not only saves time and paper, but
also guarantees a fool proof outcome. Thus, the need of the hour is to develop a
system that lets people enter and analyse the data with just a click on their
Smartphones and Personal computers.
